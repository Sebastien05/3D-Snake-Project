## The rules : 
- Catch as many apples as possible ! (Yeah this yellow bubbles)
- Don't eat your own tail (the game will finish)

Watch out for red apples, it doesn't seem harmless at the start of the game
- You can eat them like others apples
- They will dramatically increase your speed in a short time

## Mention :
You have to **manage yourself** the `Pitch axis` when turning around the surface.. In improvement
