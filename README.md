# 3D snake project ~ let's add an extra dimension to this classic game

## Snake controls : 
| Key controls                | description |
|:--------------------------- | -------------------------------: |  
| `A` and `E`                 |  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\rightleftarrows "> Roll axis movements              |	
| `Q` and `D`                 | <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\circlearrowright ">Left and Right movements         |

| space bar `_`                   | Jump (stamina at top left window)|

## The rules : 
- Catch as many apples as possible ! (Yeah this yellow bubbles)
- Don't eat your own tail (the game will finish)

Watch out for red apples, it doesn't seem harmless at the start of the game
- You can eat them like others apples
- They will dramatically increase your speed in a short time

## Mention :
You have to **manage yourself** the `Pitch axis` when turning around the surface.. In improvement
